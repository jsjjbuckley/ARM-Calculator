# ARM-Calculator
Four Function Calculator Program written in ARM Assembly for CDA 3101 Class
#Instructions from class for Programming Assignment 1 CDA 3101
Write an ARM program that implements a simple five-function calculator and prompts the user to enter a pair of decimal integers (A and B) followed by a character that specifies one of the operators:

 

‘+’ for addition to compute A+B                            

‘-‘ for subtraction to compute A-B

‘*’ for multiplication to produce the product A*B

‘/’ for division to produce the quotient A/B.

 

Your program should display the result produced by performing the indicated operation on the two input operands A and B. Only the four operators listed above should be allowed and an attempt to divide by zero should be prohibited.

Your main program should prompt the user for input operands and the operator.

 

Define a separate function for each of the allowed operators and use the function names ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV.

 

Upon return from the function, the main program should display the result on the console
